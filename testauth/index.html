<h2>Step 1: Getting an Authorization Code</h2>
<p>
    Hi! We're going to see if we can get auth tokens from Imgur for account-level API calls.
</p>
<p>
    First, you need to have already logged into your account on Imgur in another page.
    <a target="elsewhere" href="https://imgur.com">Go do that now</a> if you haven't already;
    The user needs to be logged in for this to work.
</p>
<p>
    ... o/` doo dee doo o/` ...
</p>
<p>
    Welcome back!
</p>
<p>
    All right, so now we're going to bounce from here to Imgur, passing your application's
    clientId so Imgur knows what app is trying to access the currently-logged-in account.
</p>
<p>
    You have a clientId, right?  You got it when you registered your application with Imgur.
    You received an email with it and the clientSecret.
    If you haven't done that yet, <a target="elsewhere" href="https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient">
    go do that now</a> and come back here.  When you register, select Authorization type "OAuth 2
    authorization <i>with</i> a callback URL" and-- for now-- enter
    <code>http://localhost:54321/gotcode</code> as the Authorization callback URL.
</p>
<p>
    If you have already registered your app, make sure the callback URL is set as above.  You can do this
    in the "applications" section of your <a target="elsewhere" href="https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps">
    Imgur Account Settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Now to make a request to Imgur to get an authorization code, we need to send your application's
    clientId <i>(NOT the clientSecret)</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <form method="GET" action="https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize">
        Your app's clientId: <input id="client-id-field" name="client_id" type="text"/>
<br/><br/>
    When you click the button, the page is going to visit:
    <pre>https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE</pre>
<br/>
        <input name="response_type" type="hidden" value="code"/>
        <input class="submit" type="submit" value="Ask Imgur for an auth code"/>
    </form>
</p>
</div>
</body>
