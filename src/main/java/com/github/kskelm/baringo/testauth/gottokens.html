<h2>Step 3: Save your tokens!</h2>
<p>
    And here we are... we have an access_token and a refresh_token. Here they are:
</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Access token:</td><td><code>{access_token}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Refresh token:</td><td><code>{refresh_token}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Expires in:</td><td><code>{expires_in} seconds</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Expires on:</td><td><code>{expires_on}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Token type:</td><td><code>{token_type}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Scope:</td><td><code>{scope}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>User id:</td><td><code>{user_id}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>User name:</td><td><code>{user_name}</code></td></tr>
    </table>

<p>
    Baringo is not, in itself, responsible for fetching and storing your authorization_code,
    your access_token, or your refresh_token.  You need to store those (hopefully encrypted)
    yourself someplace else, probably in a database.
</p>
<p>
    In Baringo, one BaringoClient...
</p>
    <pre>
        BaringoClient client = new BaringoClient( client_id, client_secret );
    </pre>
<p>
    ...can either access resources anonymously, or you can attach an account
    to it by calling one of the two approaches.  In the first case, you can pass your
    authorization_code to Baringo and it will attempt to automatically maintain the tokens
    for you:
</p>
    <pre>
            client.setAuthenticationCode( authentication_code );
    </pre>
<p>
<i>The down side is that authorization codes live only a few minutes!</i> You
    need to get the code into Baringo immediately so it can generate the access and refresh
    tokens, <i>or you need to do that yourself</i>.  An advantage to doing this yourself is
    that you should be the one to store the tokens anyway, encrypted in a database somewhere.
    More about that later.

    to it by passing the userName, your client_id, your client_secret, your access_token, and your
     andYour browser just hit the URL at Imgur.  They checked your client_id and checked who was logged
    in with your browser, decided whether or not that user was allowing access to your app, and the
    answer was yes.  So they checked your app's redirect URL, and they replied to your browser, issuing
    a 302 redirect to it, which led back to this page.
