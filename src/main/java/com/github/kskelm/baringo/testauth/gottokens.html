<h2>Step 3: Save your tokens!</h2>
<p>
    And here we are... we have an access_token and a refresh_token. Here they are:
</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Access token:</td><td><code>{access_token}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Refresh token:</td><td><code>{refresh_token}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Expires in:</td><td><code>{expires_in} seconds</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Expires on:</td><td><code>{expires_on}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Token type:</td><td><code>{token_type}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Scope:</td><td><code>{scope}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>User id:</td><td><code>{user_id}</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>User name:</td><td><code>{user_name}</code></td></tr>
    </table>

<p>
    Baringo is not, in itself, responsible for fetching and storing your authorization_code,
    your access_token, or your refresh_token.  You need to store those (hopefully encrypted)
    yourself someplace else, probably in a database.
</p>
<p>
    In Baringo, one BaringoClient...
</p>
    <pre>
    BaringoClient client = new BaringoClient.Builder()<br/>
            .clientAuth( clientId, clientSecret )<br/>
            .build();

    </pre>
<p>
    ...can either access resources anonymously, or you can attach an account
    to it by calling one of the two approaches.  In the first case, you can pass your
    authorization code to Baringo and it will attempt to automatically maintain the tokens
    for you:
</p>
    <pre>
    client.authService().setAuthorizationCode( String authCode );
    </pre>
<p>
<i>The down side is that authorization codes live only a few minutes once you retrieve it
    from Imgur!</i> You
    need to get the code into Baringo immediately so it can generate the access and refresh
    tokens, <i>or you need to do that yourself</i>.  An advantage to doing this yourself is
    that you should be the one to store the tokens anyway, encrypted in a database somewhere.
    More about that later.
</p>
<p>
    The second way to get user credentials into Baringo is to pass in the refresh token that
    you got from a previous session (see below).
</p>
    <pre>
    client.authService().setRefreshToken( String refreshToken );
    </pre>
<p>
    This skips the step necessary for turning authorization codes to access/refresh tokens, and
    goes straight to getting an access token.  This synchronously pings the Imgur server to
    verify the refresh token is valid and to fetch a new access token with a known Time To Live.
</p>
<p>
    Either way, once Baringo has successfully set up user-level authorization, you can ask it for
    the refresh token, <b>which you should keep</b>, stored <i>encrypted</i> in the filesystem or in your
    database.  The security of refresh tokens is vital because if someone gets ahold of them, they
    do effectively anything.
</p>
    <pre>
    String refreshToken = client.authService().getRefreshToken();<br/>
    &lt;do whatever you need to encrypt this (AES256 is fine) and store it in your database&rt;
    </pre>

<p>
    As an aside, more interesting oAuth stuff is available from:
</p>
    <pre>
    String refreshToken = client.authService().getOAuth2().getRefreshToken();
    </pre>
<p>   
    Anyway, Baringo manages access tokens passively; when you hand it credentials of some sort,
    it pre-emptively pings the Imgur servers to get a known-good access token and its expiration.
    Instead of internally re-authenticating after a failed API call attempt after an access token
    expires, it checks to see if the token is going to expire <i>soon</i> and pro-actively fetches
    a new one so the API calls themselves can stay simple.  If this turns into a problem for some
    reason, we'll change it up and do active token management.
</p>
<p> 
    So that's it!  You should have enough now to understand the basics of how OAuth2 works in general,
    and how it work with Imgur in specific.
</p>
<p> 
    You can use this tool to regenerate refresh tokens for different users for your debugging and
    experimentation.
